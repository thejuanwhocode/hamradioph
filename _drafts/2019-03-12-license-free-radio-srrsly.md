Operating a radio transmitter requires licensed to use, this is to avoid interfering with other device or service that uses the spectrum as well. 

## Citizen's Band

Mainly in the US it utilized 27MHz frequency which is already in *High Frequency (HF) Spectrum* it has 40 channels from 26.965MHz to 27.405MHz. It has longer range than FM if you have proper antenna and higher transmit power. CB radio is still active here in Philippines but it is legally illegal to operate.

## Family Radio Service

US, Canada, Mexico and most South American countries uses what is called *Family Radio Service (FRS)* is a type of PRS that uses *Narrow Band Frequency Modulation (NBFM)* with a maximum deviation of 2.5 kHz, FRS has 22 fixed channels,. It also utilized UHF spectrum from 462MHz to 467MHz, it is allowed to transmit on 2W from channel 1 to 7, 15 to 22, however channel 8 to 14 is only allowed to transmit in 500mW.

## Multi-Use Radio Service

Often called **MURS** is only available in US, In addition to UHF FRS American FCC allocated five (5) VHF channels to the MURS.

## UHF CB

Is a class-licensed Citizens Band Radio service authorized by governments of Australia, New Zealand, Vanuatu and Malaysia using UHF spectrum 477MHz. It has 77 channels, it is similar to <u>27 MHz CB Radio</u>

## PMR446

*Personal Mobile Radio, 446MHz* or abbreviated as **PMR446** is a European equivalent of FRS that utilize UHF spectrum from 446.0MHz to 446.2MHz and has 16 channel separated by 12.5kHz from each other and has maximum allowed transmit power of 500mW similar to FRS.

## KDR 444

Also know as *Short Range Business Radio (SRBR 444)* in Sweden. Is a PRS type of radio that is used in Scandinavian country like Sweden and Norway. It operates in UHF spectrum from 444.600MHz to 444.975MHz. However transmit power may differ from country, in Sweden they have allowed transmit power of 2W while Norway only allows 500mW.

## Public Channel China

Often abbreviated as PCC 409, its a Chinese equivalent of PRS with 20 channels but utilize UHF Spectrum from 409.7500MHz to 409.9875MHz.

## Short Range Radio

Often abbreviated as SRR, its India's equivalent to UHF PRS but instead they uses UHF low band 350MHz. It has 13 channel and utilizes UHF Low-Band spectrum 350.225MHz to 350.400MHz with maximum power output of 2W and has 12.5kHz channel spacing.

## Other countries...

If I mention every countries here, this article would start to become a wikipedia page so ill just share you the [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_radio_service) to wikipedia instead :).

## Philippines

We also have our own PRS, its called *Short Range Radio Service or SRRS* like India we uses Low-Band UHF spectrum but instead of 350Mhz we use 325MHz that's why it is sometimes called **SRRS 325**, it has 40 channel from 325Mhz to 325.4875Mhz. However, repeaters are not allowed it is purely portable operation.

There are few official vendor of SRRS 325 available here in Philippines, this are:

- Cignus Freetalk
- Cignus FreeTalk XT
- Versa Quicktalk
- Smart Ranger RS-1
- Vertex Standard VZ-28s

Apparently Motorola, doesn't have an official model that works on SRRS 325 but hey they own vertex standard so i guess they got that covered i guess ;)

## Recommendation

I would strongly recommend everyone that if you don't want to get into the hassle of licensing and those yearly dues, better get SRRS instead, and those radio sent by our families and friends from abroad, those are illegal radios, same thing those sold in Lazada, Shopee and even CD-R King those are illegal to use.
