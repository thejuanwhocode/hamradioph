Once you have setup your external antenna, you are most likely heard about antenna tuning and SWR.<!--more-->

SWR stands for *Standing Wave Ratio*, its the ratio of how much output power reaches the antenna against what is reflected back. When the output power is impeded the waves is called standing, it means they are not radiated the way it supposed to. A low SWR reading means your antenna is transmitting a proper amount of RF power instead of sending the excess power it back into your transmitter.

The idea of SWR reading is making sure your antenna will have lower SWR reading to avoid damaging your transmitters. When you have high SWR reading that means your antenna has low RF power and the rest is sent back through the feed line and back into the radio. This will results into your signals being weak and distorted. Or worst all those excess power return to your radio will damage the transmitter.

## Interpreting SWR reading

Tuning your antenna to an acceptable SWR is very crucial for good performance and safety of your transmitter. Below are some guidelines to give you and idea about it.

## 1.0–1.5

This is the ideal range, if your SWR is < 1.5 that means you antenna is properly tuned. However if you are ≥ 1.5 you may want to drop it down a little bit more. Tuning antenna may differ from case to case. Sometimes cutting the antenna elements may solve this, or adding a coil to the feed line. Dropping from 1.5 to 1.0 may not have any noticeable difference but it would surely make sure you transmitter is happy. Not as noticeable as going from 2.0 to 1.5.

## 1.5–1.9

At this range should still be able to provide adequate performance. If you get this reading try moving you antenna position. Sometimes adding some coil to the feed line may solve improve the reading.

## 2.0–2.4

This is not really an ideal reading, while it will not likely damaged your radio for casual use, for regular rag chewing it will.

## 3.0+

Performance at this level is severely affected and most like you radio is damaged.

**NOTE:** The damage to your radio will only happen if you transmit from an antenna with high SWR readings.
