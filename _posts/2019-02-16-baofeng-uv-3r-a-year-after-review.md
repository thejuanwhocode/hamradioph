Way back December 2016 on our club Christmas party, one of the price is a small radio. I was so curious since it is very small and portable. After searching for couple days i stumble upon Baofeng UV-3R. Thats where i started digging into this portable radio more.

Baofeng UV-3R is a copy of Yaesu VX-3R. After a year they released UV-3R Mk II with little changes to the original one.

Soon after the release of Mk II they released the latest and probably the last iteration of the UV-3R series, the UV-3R+

### Specs

Baofeng UV-3R+ is a complete redesign of its aesthetics, it doesnt resemble VX-3R anymore. It also uses a more updated firmware than the one from Mk I and II.

Size and portability is the selling point of the UV-3R series, but due to its small there are some compromise on its features _(I know there are more but this are the ones that i experienced personally)_:

*   It doesn't support channel naming
*   It doesn't have a keypad to typed the frequency, you need to do it from the single VFO/Volume/Control knob which is sometimes it is fiddly.
*   Changing the frequency could be hassle sometimes if not all the time.
*   You are limited to 4 buttons to operate.
*   Audio is still loud even if the volume is already set low.
*   Hard to find battery replacement

But with its cons comes its pros as well:

*   Portability, perfect for EDC.
*   Commonality with other Baofeng parts like antenna, programming cable and speaker mic.
*   You can actually used Sony digital camera battery as alternative, but may require some modification.
*   Good TX even if it only transmit less than 2W.

### Experience

#### Price

Its quite cheap actually, got mine for one thousand three hundred pesos (Php 1,300) from my local dealer (thats a price of new model that came out just a month), and i know the price could get lower depending on where you get it or who is selling it.

#### Battery life

I have been using my UV-3R+ as my EDC (Everyday Carry) for more than 2 years already, the only issues i have is the battery since it gets drained so fast. I normally use it for monitoring only so the battery takes couple days before it gets drained but if use it for TX it gets drained after a single day.

Battery life is not really its strong point so i suggest getting a spare battery just in case, and the charger may require some careful use, mine is broken after a week. It still charges though just needed some careful push on the cable.

#### Portability

It is also comfortable to use, i can easily put it in my EDC bag or just on my pocket it fits perfectly. I usually used scanner antenna since i just monitor most of the time. The antenna is SMA-Female so you can interchanged it with any Baofeng antenna you already have. Just word of caution though if you are planning to TX, [always make sure to do SWR reading on the antenna before using it, if the SWR reading is high it could damage the finals of your radio. 1.0–1.5 is the ideal range.](https://medium.com/@hamph/swr-for-dummies-830f09855f95)

#### TX/RX Performance

Well i don't expect it to perform well on TX since it has limited transmit power (< 2W). You could still transmit though using the stock antenna and transmitting it into a repeater. In UHF where the 3R+ shines more, VHF not really much.

However, RX is excellent, i use a scanner antenna so it is really small and i can easily pick up transmission from our local traffic agency. Since i’m usually located in an area where there is high RF noise i’m really surprise that it still have a decent RX.

### Verdict

So the verdict, will i recommend it? depends on the purpose.

If you are planning to use it for monitoring and transmitting it to a nearby repeater, then YES i would recommend this.

But if you want it to use for regular transmitting i may recommend other radio instead since this little radio is not really a top performer in terms of transmit, it transmit lesser than what it claims (2W) so not really much of a coverage and range.
