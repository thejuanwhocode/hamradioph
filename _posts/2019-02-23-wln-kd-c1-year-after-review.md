When this little thing came everybody is talking about it, it is small, compact and very loud. Nope its not the [Baofeng UV-3R+](https://medium.com/@hamph/baofeng-uv-3r-a-year-after-review-3aa0f99e3881), its WLN KD-C1. I have this little radio for more than a year now and I could certainly say it became my favorite that it is now my EDC radio.

### Specs

### Experience

### Price

Its dirt cheap really cheap. Nothing more to say but cheap!

#### Battery life

Impressive, mine last for 3 days without being turned off. The good is i can charge it using PC USB port, a feature that i wish other radio should have as well.

_This battery reminds me of the Nokia BL-5C which looks them same even the specs are almost the same, even the name :)._

#### Portability

Portability is one of its selling point, the non-removable antenna is actually advantageous for portability since you don’t have to worry about breaking the antenna port. KD-C1 fits perfectly on my pocket.

#### TX/RX Performance

Transmit is mediocre cant say its good but i cant say its bad either. Truth is i rarely used it to transmit since we don’t have UHF repeater in my area. But i do use it for simplex with my family which really works but only on limited range like inside a building. Since this is a UHF radio if works well in built up areas.

Receive audio is loud.. really loud, i’m not surprised since it uses a 1 watt speaker. For a radio this size its packs a punch and i guess thats one of the selling point.

#### Pros and Cons

Pros:   
\- Small and portable  
\- Fixed antenna  
\- Good battery life  
\- Loud audio  
\- Cheap price  
\- You can use programming cable from Baofeng

**Cons:**  
\- UHF (well you can actually put VHF but that would be limited by the antenna)  
\- Non field programmable, requires computer to program  
\- Audio is loud that sometimes its already annoying  
\- Brittle belt-clip

### Verdict

Will i recommend this? certainly.
