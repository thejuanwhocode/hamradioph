This is the first radio that I bought upon recommendation from a ham friend, I got this radio from a local Cignus dealer for a 2,500 pesos, I also bought a Cignus RH-771 dual band whip antenna. This was my EDC radio for three years because it is very portable and uses the same accessories which i already have.

### First impression

Cignus UV-85 series

They say first impression last, well it did in some way. This little radio closely resembles [Baofeng FF-12P (UV-5X)](https://hamgear.wordpress.com/2015/03/17/review-baofeng-ff-12p-uv-5x/), I’m not surprise since Cignus UV-82 is basically a rebranded OEM of famous Baofeng UV-5R.

### Accessories

Finding accessories for this one is quite easy since it is compatible with most accessories for UV-5 series except for battery. From speaker mic to antenna you can easily interchange them with other Chinese made radio this type.

### Performance

Performance in transmit is good for its price, those extra transmit power is quite useful when propagation is not really good in your current location, though using high power would have drained your batter fast. However, the receiver of this radio is mediocre like most Chinese radio. UV-85+ can easily be over-modulated (bingi) if you connect it to an external antenna or you are located on an high RF traffic area. This is due to the design made by the manufacturer, they use [Direct Conversion receiver](/blogs/superheterodyne-vs-direct-conversion.html) in their system on chip (SoC). This drastically lowers the manufacturing cost since it doesn't need those bulky and expensive IF filter most branded expensive radio has.

Battery life is also good, mine last for 4 days with casual use. However, I notice that the longer you use the radio in transmitting, the battery charger terminal gets warm to the point that you can actually feel that your hands are burning.

### Pros and Cons

#### Pros  
* Cheap, value for money  
* Uses same accessories compatible with other Chinese radio  
* High Power, quite handy when you need more power to transmit  
* Good battery life  
* Support and warranty

#### Cons  
* Uses direct conversion receiver, the means it can get easily over-modulated  
* Battery charger terminal gets how with prolong transmit  
* It says it can transmit 8w, well it doesn't on all frequency, but still it transmits above 5 watts

### Verdict

Will I recommend this? if you’re looking for a starter radio I would certainly recommend this than Baofeng UV-5R or UV-82. Because those service warranty is quite handy one day. Apart from that I wouldn't recommend this for daily driver. You’ll better off getting those budget Yaesu radio which is technically same with most Chinese radio except they added some software based IF filter, may not as good as the hardware base but it’s an improvement.
